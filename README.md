# Air-Plane-Price-Prediction

Features in Data set are :


1. Airline         : Names of the companies, that provide Airplane services.
2. Source          : Source Airport.
3. Destination     : Destination Airport.
4. Date_of_Journey : Date of journey by a Passenger.
5. Route           : route of the air flight from source to destination.
6. Dep_Time        : Departure time of the flight from Source air port.
7. Arrival_Time    : Arrival time of the flight to Destination air port.
8. Total_Stops     : number stops b/w source & destination airports.
9. Duration        : Time taken or journey time from source to destination.
10. AdditionalInfo : addition info like ood availability.
11. Price          : of the ticket.


I uploaded  both train & test fines.



We've to calculate Price for the ticket between Source & Destination airports.

# Preprocessing Data :

Data set must goes through lots of Preprocessing steps.
But don't worry i explained clearly & used most of the techniques to preprocesses the data.

preprocessing techniques :
    1. Nominal data
    2. Ordinal Data
    
    
1. Nominal data : categorial data contain types of category which are nominal to one another.
2. For Nominal data One hot encoding is used.
3. Ordinal data : cattegorial data which has order of types i n categorial data.
4. For Ordinal data Label Encoder is used.


Machine Learning Models used is Random Forest Regressor.
We can also tune with other basic models with hyper parameters for accuracy.


Technologies used :

    1. pandas 
    2. matplot
    3. seaborn
    4. sklearn 
    5. numpy ... etc.
